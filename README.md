# 🧩 Ruby on Rails Technical Challenge – RSpec Testing

## 📌 Overview
This repository was created as part of a **Ruby on Rails (RoR) technical challenge**.  
The main objective was to write and execute automated tests using **RSpec** to verify the functionality of Ruby classes and logic.  
It demonstrates understanding of **unit testing**, **JSON data handling**, and **test-driven development (TDD)** principles.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Ruby**
- **RSpec** for testing  
- **Bundler** for dependency management  
- **JSON** data (`clients.json`)

---

## 🧪 Testing Details
The repository contains:
- Test cases written with **RSpec** inside the `spec/` folder  
- Logic and helper files in the `lib/` directory  
- A sample data file `clients.json` used for testing  

These tests ensure that the Ruby logic behaves correctly and handles various edge cases.
